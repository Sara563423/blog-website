        <h2>Hi, I'm Saravanan Pushparaj</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my blog! I'm Saravanan Pushparaj, a passionate web developer, and lifelong learner. My journey into the world of coding began with a curiosity about how websites work and has turned into a full-blown passion. Over the years, I've learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many other web development technologies. I enjoy building beautiful, functional websites and experimenting with new designs and interactive features.
        </p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            My background isn’t in tech. In fact, I started off studying Mechanical Engineering. It wasn’t until I decided to take a beginner coding class that I realized web development was where my true passion lay. After completing a few online courses and building my first project from scratch, I knew I had found my calling. From there, I continued my education, diving deep into front-end development and eventually expanding my skills to include full-stack development.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Do</h3>
        <p>
            I currently specialize in creating dynamic and responsive websites, ensuring that they look and work great on all devices. I’m particularly passionate about user experience (UX) and making the web accessible to everyone. My favorite tools and frameworks include:
            <ul>
                <li>HTML & CSS for structuring and styling web pages</li>
                <li>JavaScript for interactivity and client-side logic</li>
                <li>React for building scalable, modern web applications</li>
                <li>Node.js for server-side scripting</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Why I Started This Blog</h3>
        <p>
            I started this blog as a way to document my journey, share my thoughts, and help others who are learning web development. I believe in the power of community and knowledge-sharing, and I hope my posts can inspire and guide others who are just starting their coding journey. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, I hope you find something valuable here.
        </p>

        <h3>Beyond Web Development</h3>
        <p>
            When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring other hobbies like playing cricket. I’m also a huge fan of lifelong learning, and I’m constantly picking up new skills and reading about the latest trends in tech. I believe that staying curious and adaptable is key to growth in both personal and professional life.
